    /// This property was added as a workaround to a flaw in Apple's current implementation with the collection view's size which is reported when transitioning to a new size class. The collection view referenced on the `UICollectionViewLayout` object has stale size data as does the `collectionView` parameter passed into the delegate methods. As a workaround, this property was added so that we can keep the flow layout object decoupled from the collection view and still get accurate size data.
