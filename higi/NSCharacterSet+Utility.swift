    /// component is `key1=value1`. The individual parameters of that query would be the key `key1`

    ///
    /// `ALPHA / DIGIT / "-" / "." / "_" / "~"`

    /// In section 3.4 of the RFC, it further recommends adding `/` and `?` to the list of unescaped characters
    /// for the sake of compatibility with some erroneous implementations, so this routine also allows those
    /// to pass unescaped.
